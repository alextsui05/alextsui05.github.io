Here's an overview of my Github projects.

## Plugins

### [VimAddin](http://github.com/alextsui05/VimAddin)
MonoDevelop had a vi input mode that really needed some love, so I yanked the
code from the IDE, repacked it as an Addin, and fixed a number of issues.

### [blender-off-addon](http://github.com/alextsui05/blender-off-addon)
There was no official addon to load OFF format meshes in Blender, so I wrote a
simple one.
 
## Scripts, Templates, Odds & Ends

* [**toolbox**](http://alextsui05.github.io/toolbox) - A lot of one-file scripts here.
* [**latex-tikz-template**](http://github.com/alextsui05/latex-tikz-template) - A simple LaTeX Makefile project that you can get
  started right away with.
* [**dotfiles**](http://github.com/alextsui05/dotfiles) - the conventional user config repo

## CMake forks

I rehost some open-source projects that I found useful here. My contribution
was to add on CMake as the build system so that I could splice it into my own
research projects.

* [**remesher**](http://github.com/alextsui05/remesher) - Fork of this [nice remeshing software](http://www.gris.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/%7Esfuhrman/remesher.html).
* [**gmock**](http://github.com/alextsui05/gmock)
* [**glog**](http://github.com/alextsui05/glog)
* [**yaml-cpp**](http://github.com/alextsui05/yaml-cpp)
* [**clausen**](http://github.com/alextsui05/clausen) - I could not depend on GNU Scientific Library for just this one
  function, so I wrote it myself.
