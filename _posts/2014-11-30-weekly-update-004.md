Nothing to report. According to the schedule, I won't be working on anything other than this paper deadline for the next three weeks, so look forward for development to resume there. Specifically, I have features on backlog for VimAddin.

Note to self: post one-off scripts and tools as a gist that aren't large enough to constitute a full repository project. At least it will be tied to my account somewhere and be searchable/referencable as opposed to being buried in a local directory on my desktop.
