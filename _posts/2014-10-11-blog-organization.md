To avoid making this redundant with the GitHub Pages blog that I have on [alextsui05.github.io](http://alextsui05.github.io), I've decided to use GitHub Pages for reporting on my plans and progress on open source projects. The blogs are similar in that they are outlets for me to write about things that I learn and want to talk about. The blogs will be different in that the focus of the GitHub Pages blog will be strictly related to my open source projects and open source involvement.

Hacked on the [Shiori](http://ellekasai.github.io/shiori/) theme, which is what you see as of this post. Added some pagination. I wish it was easier in Jekyll to swap themes. Maybe it will get easier when I learn more.
