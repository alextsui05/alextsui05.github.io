title: Weekly Update 14 - Tidying up projects
category: 'Weekly Update'
---
I took the time to commit some small little projects I've accumulated over the
past month or so.  Check out [toolbox](http://alextsui05.github.io/toolbox),
where I will stash my small scripts from now on. Check out
[latex-tikz-template](https://github.com/alextsui05/latex-tikz-template) which
is a template LaTeX makefile project that I'd been wishing that I had.

I know it takes someone actually poking around to find things and figure out
how they're used, but in general, I'm just trying to make these things a little
more visible by making pages describing what they'll find here and there.

In other news, CGAL is coming to Github very, very soon! I'm going to have to
write a blog about the new surface mesh data structure introduced in 4.6, and I
need to tend to the arrangement demo as well.
