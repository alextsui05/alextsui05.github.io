title: Weekly Update 1
---

For now, I've decided to go with posting weekly updates on Sunday. At a minimum, I'll post to report that there's been no activity.

I'm pretty happy that [VimAddin](https://github.com/alextsui05/VimAddin) has acquired over a dozen stars, which shows that there is interest in the C# community for improving the tool. I've received both email and pull request about it recently. Revision 1.1.8 corrects the issue where the motion `[de]` does not include the last character at the end of the token in the deletion -- thanks to [yixiang](https://github.com/yixiang) for the patch.

I anticipate in the next five weeks, I will not have very much activity on Github, since I will be busy trying to make something happen for a school-related deadline.
