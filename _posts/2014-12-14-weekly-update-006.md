Nothing to report besides the shameful accumulation of cobwebs on my repositories this week. I even found a long-forgotten opened issue on the [blender-off-addon](https://github.com/alextsui05/blender-off-addon) project that asked for clarification about whether export works because of a stale label... Well, I fixed that, so I guess that's something.

Next weekend for sure I will have something to report on. By this time next week, I will have finished this quarter off with a paper submission and officially on winter break. I'll catch up with a lot of things that I have backlogged, but specifically I will get to work adding a menu to [VimAddin](https://github.com/alextsui05/VimAddin/issues/10).

Almost there!
