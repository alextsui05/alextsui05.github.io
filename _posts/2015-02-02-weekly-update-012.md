title: Weekly Update 12 - Custom key bindings in VimAddin
category: 'Weekly Update'

This weekly update comes slightly delayed. Just wanted to say that the problem from [last week]({% post_url 2015-01-25-weekly-update-011 %}) has been fixed. The reason why it hasn't been scrubbed and published yet is because I was running into some technical difficulties from a source build of Monodevelop I was testing on. I just tested the addin manually on the latest stable release of Monodevelop (4.7 as of this writing) and it seems to be working fine. So look forward to an update being pushed out during this week some time.

Finally, we can scroll up and down again!
