Happy new year. I took some time off to work on non-coding hobbies, so I missed the last Sunday before the new year, but now I'm back.

This week, I got my feet wet with a little Ruby and tacked on categories for the Shiori theme. I've updated this and my personal blog to have categories but not my academic site since I don't plan to blog a ton on it. Anyways, if you are interested in having it, check out my [fork](http://alextsui05.github.io/shiori/categories-in-shiori).
