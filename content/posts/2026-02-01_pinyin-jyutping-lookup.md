As a Chinese language learner, being able to look up Chinese words is essential, and while the resources available make it easier than ever, a lot of relevant information is fragmented and introduces friction in the learning process. I created a React app that lets you transliterate a snippet of Chinese text, breaking up the individual words and displaying the phonetic reading underneath each word as a reading aid. The app allows toggling between Mandarin Pinyin and Cantonese Jyutping readings. The app also allows toggling between traditional and simplified scripts. When combined with an OCR tool like Google Lens and a mouseover dictionary extension like Zhongwen, this app makes for a great reading aid. Try the app out [here](https://atsui.click/pinyin-jyutping-lookup).
