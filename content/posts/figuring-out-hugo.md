Here are some notes from setting up the `ananke` theme.

- Add `sectionPagesMenu = 'main'` to `hugo.toml` to enable the section links in the upper right
- I couldn't figure out how to add social media links when I installed the theme with git submodules. It worked when I installed it the hugo modules way though.
