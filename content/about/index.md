I spent a good number of years in school studying computer science, after which
I spent a good number of years as a backend engineer for a Tokyo-based startup
called Lang-8. The company made a great web app of the same name where you
could post blogs in your language of study and have an audience of native
speakers of that language proofread and comment on it. It played a part in
improving my written Japanese and allowed me to take on the challenge of moving
and working in Japan. Currently, I'm back in the Bay Area, in my hometown of
San Jose, seeking new challenges.
