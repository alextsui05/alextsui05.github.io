This is my open journal on my open source projects and activities. Besides what you see through the commit history of my repositories, I will post here to report on what you can't see, like what I technically struggle with on a weekly basis as a programmer/computer scientist, and what I plan to work on in the near future.  If you want to know more about me, hop over to my personal twin site at [atsui.me](http://atsui.me).
